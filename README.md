# First college project.
Very simple project done a few years ago in my **Systems Analysis and Development** course at UMC, with the aim of creating a **CRUD** application, where I learned how to register, edit, read and delete data, which in the case of this project it is for candidates, with connection to a database.

Technologies used:

- JAVA
- PostgresSQL
